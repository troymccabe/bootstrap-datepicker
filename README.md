# Bootstrap-Datepicker
This datepicker is modeled after [Eternicode's](http://eternicode.github.io/bootstrap-datepicker/) fork of
[Stefan Petre's](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/) bootstrap-datepicker.

Under the hood, there are quite a few differences between those projects and this one. Mostly, that this does
not take on the responsibility of doing things like popover placement or date formatting--those things can be done
better by other projects (bootstrap/popover.js & moment.js).
